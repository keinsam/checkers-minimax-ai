# Checkers Game with AI implemented in C++

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of American Checkers (also known as English Draughts) created using C++. The game includes a player-versus-AI mode where the AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making.

## Installation

To run the game, you need to compile the source code using any C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.

## Usage

After compiling the game, you can run it by executing the generated executable.

The game will launch, and you'll be presented with the main menu. From there, you can start to play.

## AI Implementation

The AI opponent in the player-versus-AI mode is not yet implemented. Future updates will include the implementation of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to create a challenging AI opponent.
